It was built by the Third Earl of Annseley in the 1830s to serve his Donard lodge residence.

You'll be greeted by the beautiful dry-stone Mourne Wall which was constructed to enclose a catchment area of the Silent Valley Reservoir. This wall took almost 20 years to complete with the build staring in 1904. The project was overseen by Belfast City and Distict Water Commissioners and built by local stone masons. Follow the wall east and up the hill to get to the peak of Slieve Donard.",

A turret built into the mourne wall which can provide a bit of shelter in the colder months, and a large pile of stones. The large pile of stones is the site of a pre-historic burial cairn and there's another situatied further north east overlooking newcastle. ",
